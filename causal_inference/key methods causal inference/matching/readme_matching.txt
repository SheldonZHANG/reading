Sekhon, J. S. (in press). Matching: Multivariate and propensity score matching
with balance optimization. Forthcoming, Journal of Statistical Software. Uses
automated procedure to select matches, based on univariate and multivariate
balance diagnostics. Primarily k:1 matching, allows matching with or without
replacement, caliper, exact. Includes built-in effect and variance estimation
procedures

analysis. Wide array of estimation procedures and matching methods available:
nearest neighbor, Mahalanobis, caliper, exact, full, optimal, subclassification.
Built-in numeric and graphical diagnostics.
